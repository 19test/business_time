= business_time

ActiveSupport gives us some great helpers so we can do things like:

  5.days.ago

and

  8.hours.from_now

as well as helpers to do that from any provided date or time.

I needed this, but taking into account business hours/days and holidays.

== Usage
* install the gem

* open up your console

    # if in irb, add these lines:
  
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'active_support'
    require 'business_time'

    # try these examples, using the current time:
  
    1.business_hour.from_now
    4.business_hours.from_now
    8.business_hours.from_now

    1.business_hour.ago
    4.business_hours.ago
    8.business_hours.ago

    1.business_day.from_now
    4.business_days.from_now
    8.business_days.from_now

    1.business_day.ago
    4.business_days.ago
    8.business_days.ago

    # and we can do it from any Date or Time object.
    my_birthday = Date.parse("August 4th, 1969")
    8.business_days.after(my_birthday)
    8.business_days.before(my_birthday)

    my_birthday = Time.parse("August 4th, 1969, 8:32 am")
    8.business_days.after(my_birthday)
    8.business_days.before(my_birthday)


    # We can adjust the start and end time of our business hours
    BusinessTime::Config.beginning_of_workday = "8:30 am"
    BusinessTime::Config.end_of_workday = "5:30 pm"

    # and we can add holidays that don't count as business days
    # July 5 in 2010 is a monday that the U.S. takes off because our independence day falls on that Sunday.
    three_day_weekend = Date.parse("July 5th, 2010")
    BusinessTime::Config.holidays << three_day_weekend
    friday_afternoon = Time.parse("July 2nd, 2010, 4:50 pm")
    tuesday_morning = 1.business_hour.after(friday_afternoon)



== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

== TODO
* I'd like to return ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone just like the equivalent ActiveSupport helpers do.
* if it doesn't pollute the logic too much, I'd like to vary the days counted as 'business days'.  Bakers often don't work on Mondays, for instance.
* We don't care much about timezones.  Dunno if thats an issue.
